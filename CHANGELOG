# Unreleased
 - Moves the responsibility of running the event loop from the `App` struct and
   into the backend. This inversion of control help reduce sys dependencies in
   zi::App (moves tokio dependency to the `crossterm` backend which was moved to
   a separate crate, yay). This change allows for different implementations of
   the event loop (e.g. using winit which will come in handy for a new
   experimental wgpu backend).
